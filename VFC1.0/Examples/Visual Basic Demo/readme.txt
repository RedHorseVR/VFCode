THIS IS A SIMPLE, STRIPPED DOWN CALCULATOR EXAMPLE THAT USES 
INSECTA TO HOLD THE CODE FOR THE 'CE' AND 'CUSTOM' BUTTONS.

TO MAKE A CHANGE YOU MUST ALTER THE INSECTA FLOW DIAGRAM AND 
THEN EXPORT IT TO A .BAS FILE. 

1) RUN INSECTA_DEMO.EXE AND DRAG-DROP, OR FILE/OPEN CALC.INS INTO INSECTA.

2) TO VIEW THE VB FLOWCHART COMMENTS USE THE VIEW/SHOW COMMENTS, OR RIGHT MOUSE/SHOW COMMENTS.

3) EDIT THE STATEMENT THAT SAYS TheForm.Readout = "INSECTA" BY DOUBLE CLICKING
   IT OR HI-LIGHTING IT AND USING THE RIGHT MOUSE/ EDIT PROPERTIES COMMAND.

4) CHANGE IT TO SAY: TheForm.Readout = "CLEAR OUT" 

5) GO TO THE FILE/EXPORT MENU ITEM.

6) AFTER EXPORTING YOU SHOULD CLOSE VB IF IT IS OPEN.  IF VB IS OPEN WHEN YOU
    EXPORT TO ONE OF ITS  *.BAS FILES IT WON'T KNOW IT AND WILL NOT USE THE  
    CHANGES.  REOPENING VB WILL FORCE IT TO RELOAD THE *.BAS FILES

7) OPEN THE VB PROJECT AND LOAD THE CALC PROJECT

8) RUN THE CALC AND HIT THE CE BUTTON - YOU WILL SEE THE EFFECT OF YOUR  
    CHANGES.

9) IF YOU GET ANY ERRORS JUST NOTICE THE COMMENTED LINE NUMBER IN THE EXPORTED
   SOURCE AND USE INSECTA'S EDIT/JUMP_TO_LINE_NUMBER TO FIND THE DIAGRAM OBJECT
   TO FIX.  BE SURE TO RELOAD THE CHANGES BEFORE RUNNING.
