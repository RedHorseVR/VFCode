TO INSTALL AN INSECTA VFC RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT KIT (VFC-RDK):

1) Assuming that you have downloaded the language resource kit that you are interested in, determine the compiler and/or IDE support you will need and go into its sub-directory.  Note that not all of these resource kits have multiple compiler support.  You may however examine and modify the provided files to use whatever compiler you have even if we do not currently support it.  If you have developed support for a particular IDE or compiler (e.g. GNU C++) feel free to email it to us and we will include it on our resources page ( credited to you, of course ).
 
2) Make sure you have installed your language compiler and associated IDE, and that you know what directory it is in.  In a few cases a sharware compiler may be included as a zip file, or you might have followed one of our suggested links to a sharware compiler.  If you are using a shareware compiler, please read the copyright and licensing files when installing.  These VFC-RDK files are setup assuming a typical install on the default c: drive.  If your installation is different you will need to edit the .key files an any included .ins/.bat accordingly.
 
3) Copy the .key files to the <Insecta VFC Install Dir> / <Libs> directory.  Note: You can open the Insecta VFC Install Directory from Insecta VFC's  View | VFC Program Directory menu item.
 
4) Copy any provided .bat files (and their corresponding VFC .ins) files into the compiler's installation directory.
 
5) Copy the example project files to a working directory and run the examples to test Insecta VFC's new lanaguage bindings.  In most cases you should be able to push the a programmed toolbar button and call up your IDE, compiler , link or run the .exe.  {some WinNT4 an all NT3.x setups may not work 100% with the current console system}
