TO INSTALL A VFC RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT KIT (VFC-RDK):

1) Assuming that you have downloaded the language resource kit that you are interested in, determine the compiler and/or IDE support you will need and go into its sub-directory.

2) Make sure you have installed your language compiler and associated IDE, and that you know what directory it is in.  In a few cases a sharware compiler may be included as a zip file

3) Copy the .key files to the <Insecta VFC Install Dir> / <Libs> directory.  Note: You can open the Insecta VFC Install Directory from Insecta VFC's  View | VFC Program Directory menu item.

4) Copy any provided .bat files (and their corresponding VFC .ins) files into the compiler's installation directory.

5) Copy the example project files to a working directory and run the examples to test Insecta VFC's new lanaguage bindings.  In most cases you should be able to push a programmed toolbar button to compile
