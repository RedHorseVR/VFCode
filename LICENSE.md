# Dual-License Notice for VFCode and Related Tools

VFCode and its associated tools (“the Software”) are provided under a **dual-license model**. Users may operate under **either** the GNU General Public License v3.0 **or** a commercial license.

Under the GPLv3 option, users must:

## 2. Discretionary Use for Active Collaborators

Organizations or individuals **actively engaged with the author** (employment, consulting, or direct collaboration) may exceed the above thresholds **at the author’s discretion** for the duration of the engagement.  Activity under this clause requires all OSS contributions to be upstreamed, and the author reserves the right to terminate this discretionary use at any time.

A **commercial license is required** for any use that does not meet the GPLv3 eligibility criteria. This includes:

- Organizations with **4 or more developers**
- Organizations with **annual revenue above $5,000,000 USD**
- Any substantial commercial use beyond the GPLv3 scope
- Any use where GPLv3 obligations are undesirable or incompatible

The Software **may not be used**, in whole or in part, to train, fine-tune, develop, evaluate, or improve any artificial intelligence model, large language model (LLM), machine-learning system, or similar technology (“AI Systems”) **without explicit written permission** from the copyright holder.

This restriction:
- Applies to commercial, non-commercial, academic, and research uses
