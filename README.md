# FUTURE REPO LOCATION FOR THE VFC TOOL WINDOWS VERSION

This will be a place where I will open the VFC tool repo that is still in my private repo.  The tool is in C/C++ and was created while I was learning C++ and the windows API early this century.  Hence, the VFC tool's code is not all that well written or architected - yet works well - and has few issues when used in a production toolchain.  

However, the tool's code is encased in the VFC metat language and can be traveresed using the VFC tools,  edited as flowgraphs, exported to the compiler, integrated with a debugger, etc.. The tool today is ~100K loc and is maintained as a Visual Studio project.  

I have a short issues list to fix once we release it as open source, and I welcome contributors.  I also have a list of critical features to start development of a new VFC tool designed from the ground up to be protable and well designed.  Let me know if you want to explore a collaboration.

Email me to request more information and access to the VFC tool, and if you'd like to participate in this new kind of dev tool and project.

# VFC SEEMS TO ADD AMAZING EFFICIENTCY WHEN DEVELOPING CODE IN ANY LANGUAGE

If you review the insignts on commits done early in 2025 using the VFC tool - with AI LLMs - to build a prouction prototype in a few months, you can see the productivity increases that are possible.  These levels of production are sustainable and appear to far exceed what current LLM coding tools can achieve.

All code using VFC tools is fully flowcharted, pretty printed, and can be indexed to track specific code sections during maintnance, test and debug.
