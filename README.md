# VFCode Tool : Visual FlowChart Programming for All Text-Based Languages

## What is VFC?
VFC (Visual FlowChart) is a powerful tool that enables developers to view and edit any text-based programming language through intuitive flowgraphs. Instead of scrolling through thousands of lines of code, VFC transforms your code into visual flowcharts that can be edited, traversed, and managed visually - then exports back to standard code for compilation.

## üöÄ Current Status
- The original VFC tool (~100K LOC) exists in a private repository
- Written in C/C++ using the Windows API
- Currently maintained as a Visual Studio project
- Looking for contributors to help with maintenance and version 2.0 development
- A Windows Binary Version (VFC1.0 Folder - A *messy* copy of my working tool) is avaialble under the current license
- Visual Studio project source to follow

## üîç Key Features
- Transform any text-based code into interactive flowgraphs
- Edit code visually through an intuitive flowchart interface
- Export to standard code for compilation
- Integrates with debuggers
- Traverses large codebases efficiently
- Increases development productivity dramatically

## üìà Proven Productivity Increases
Recent GitHub contribution data from early 2025 shows exceptional productivity levels when combining VFC with AI tools:
- Sustained high-volume code production
- Complete maintainability of generated code
- Full flowchart documentation automatically created
- Code indexing for efficient tracking during maintenance and debugging

These productivity gains appear to far exceed what's possible with standard LLM coding tools alone.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Getting Involved
There are several ways to contribute to the VFC project:

1. **Immediate Needs** - Help with:
   - Fixing existing issues in the current implementation
   - Improving documentation
   - Testing and reporting bugs

2. **Version 2.0 Planning** - Contribute to:
   - Architecture design for a portable version
   - Modern UI/UX improvements
   - Support for additional languages and platforms

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
- **Phase 1:** Open source the current Windows-based VFC tool
- **Phase 2:** Fix critical issues in current implementation
- **Phase 3:** Begin development of portable VFC 2.0
- **Phase 4:** Release cross-platform version with enhanced capabilities

## üìö Documentation
*Coming soon* - Will include:
- User guides
- Architecture documentation
- Sample flowgraphs
- Development setup instructions
- *VERY* Early version of the documentation is at: http://redhorsevr.com/VFCmanual1.0/

## üì∑ Examples and Screenshots
*Coming soon* - Visual examples of VFC in action
