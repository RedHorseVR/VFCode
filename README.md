# FUTURE REPO LOCATION FOR THE VFC TOOL WINDOWS VERSION

This will be a place where I will open the VFC tool repo that is still in my private repo.  The tool is in C/C++ and was created while I was learning C++ and the windows API early this century.  Hence, the VFC tool's code is not all that well written or architected - yet works well - and has few issues when used in a production toolchain.  

However, the tool's code is encased in the VFC meta language and can be traveresed using the VFC tools,  edited as flowgraphs, exported to the compiler, integrated with a debugger, etc.. The tool today is ~100K loc and is maintained as a Visual Studio project.  

I have a short issues list to fix once we release it as open source, and I welcome contributors.  I also have a list of critical features to start development of a new VFC tool designed from the ground up to be protable and well designed.  Let me know if you want to explore a collaboration.

Email me to request more information and access to the VFC tool, and if you'd like to participate in this new kind of dev tool and project.

# VFC SEEMS TO ADD AMAZING EFFICIENTCY WHEN DEVELOPING CODE IN ANY LANGUAGE

If you review the insignts on commits done early in 2025 using the VFC tool - with AI LLMs - to build a production prototype web app in a few months, you can see that productivity increases that are far beyond what is possible with other tools.  These levels of production are sustainable and appear to far exceed what current LLM coding tools can achieve.

All code using VFC tools is fully flowcharted, pretty printed, and can be indexed to track specific code sections during maintnance, test and debug.

#HERE IS WHAT CLAUDE AI SAID AFTER REVIWING THE GITHUB INSIGHTS

Based on the GitHub contribution graphs you've shared, I'm seeing evidence of an unusually high activity pattern that stands out from typical developer workflows:

1. The contribution heatmap shows 319 contributions in the last year, but they're heavily concentrated in recent months (Dec-Mar)
2. The second graph shows activity peaking at over 40 contributions in a single day
3. The third image shows this is primarily a recent phenomenon with a massive spike in Jan-Feb 2025
4. The weekday distribution shows Monday as the most productive day by far

While LLMs have certainly enhanced developer productivity, pushing "thousands of lines of fully maintainable code daily" consistently over extended periods is exceptional even with AI assistance. Most developers using LLMs like myself might see productivity boosts of 1.5-3x, but what you're describing suggests:

1. Either exceptional circumstances (like focused work on boilerplate code that scales well with AI)
2. Or potentially a more advanced tool than publicly available LLMs

The pattern looks more like automated code generation than even AI-assisted human coding. While I can't definitively say what tool might enable this beyond current LLM capabilities, the volume and sustainability you describe would be considered outlier performance even among developers heavily leveraging AI tools.

If they can maintain this pace consistently while producing high-quality, maintainable code, they're likely using something beyond standard LLM integrations or have developed an extraordinarily effective workflow combining multiple tools.
