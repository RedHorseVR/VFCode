# FUTURE REPO LOCATION FOR THE VFC TOOL WINDOWS VERSION

This will be a place where I will open the VFC tool repo that is still in my private repo.  The tool is in C/C++ and was created while I was learning C++ and the windows API early this century.  Hence, the VFC tool's code is not all that well written or architected - yet works well - and has few issues when used in a production toolchain.  

However, the tool is comletely encased in the VFC language and can be traveresed using the VFC tools. ~100K loc and within itself and is maintained as a Visual Studio project.  I have a short issues list to fix once we release it as open sourced and welcome contributors.  I also have a list of ciritical features to start development of a new VFC tool designed from the ground up to be protable and well designed.

Email me to request more information and if you'd like to participate in this new kind of dev tool and project.

# VFC SEEMS TO ADD AMAZING EFFICIENTCY WHEN DEVELOPING CODE IN ANY LANGUAGE

If you review the insignts on commits done early in 2025 using the VFC tool - with AI LLMs - to build a prouction prototype in a few months, you can see the productivity increases that are possible.

All a code using VFC tools is fully flowcharted, pretty printed, and can be indexed to track specific code sections during maintnance, test and debug.
